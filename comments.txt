Right now you have an error in your first question because there's an extra quotation mark at the end of it. Other than that, this seems like a great start. I couldn't tell if the rest would run because of that one error, but other than that, it seems a solid pattern to follow for a short quiz game. Check as well to make sure your response to the incorrect answers will match the question because one of them seems out of place currently.
